This project is a simple Library app. Users can add books with a title, author, number of pages, and read status.
Each book is represented as an object and displayed dynamically in the browser. The interface allows users to toggle the read status or remove books.
The goal of this project was to reinforce key front-end development concepts such as working with the DOM, updating the UI dynamically, and managing data locally without any frameworks.
